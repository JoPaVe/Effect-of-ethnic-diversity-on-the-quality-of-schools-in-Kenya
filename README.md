Bachelor thesis: Effect of ethnic diversity on the quality of schools in Kenya

I used a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset to analyze the hypothesis of Miguel und Gugerty (2005) that ethnic diversity has a negative impact on the quality of schools because of lower school funding in ethnically diverse communities.
For this, I analyzed the data, defined dependent variables, calculated independent variables, and ran OLS, Logit, and Ordered Logit regressions in Stata.
